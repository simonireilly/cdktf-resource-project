## Mission Statement

Terraform allows deploying resources to many different cloud providers, but it is not intuitive.
p
## Part 1

Create a simple way to deploy common things.

## Part 2

Think about whether or not good abstraction can exist to deploy common patterns across different pieces of infrastructure?

```ts
class Site extends cdktf.Resource {
  constructor(scope: cdktf.Construct, name: string, props?: SiteProps) {
    super(scope, name)

    this.provider: props.provider

    this.resource = new SiteAdapters[this.provider](...props)
  }

  SiteAdapters = {
    'cloudflare': CloudFlarePagesResource
  }
}
```

## Structure

- .build
  - Temp files created by esbuild
- .gen
  - Providers generated by `cdktf get`
- cdktf.out
  - ??
- dist
  - Build for all files used by cdktf
